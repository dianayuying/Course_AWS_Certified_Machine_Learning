# Problem Statement

Identifying 10 sensors location across the globe based on the UFO sighting.
<p>What type of generalization are we trying to make?
<p>Do we have enough data? What does our data look like?
<p>What algorithm can help us solve this problem?
<p>Where should we launch the sensors?

### Hint
Use Amazon Sagemaker and K-Means clustering algorithm to locate
the 10 best locations.  Visualize the locations in QuickSight
